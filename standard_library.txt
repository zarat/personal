This is a list of all the currently implemented standard library functions.
I have not yet implemented all the functions that I would like to, so a
list of functions that I am planning on including sometime in the future
follows this list.

*-----IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS-----*
Global functions:

- compile(...): compiles any arbitrary number of strings containing Poe 
source code or files which contain Poe source code into executable bytecode
objects.

- copy(...): takes any number of string, array, or table objects and produces
copies of each.

- eq?(struct1,struct2): returns true if two given structures are equal. The
structures are considered "equal" if each of their corresponding elements
are equal.

- export(src [, dest]): takes one or two tables. If two tables are given, 
the elements in src are copied to dest. If only one table is given, the
elements in src are copied into the global table.

- fold(f, init, iter): Performs a fold operation according to the given 
function f, initial value init, and iterable structure iter.

- I(...): returns all the arguments it received, unchanged.

- load(...): Compiles and *executes* any number of strings containing source
code or files containing source code, exporting the definitions therein
to the global table.

- map(f, iter): maps a function f over a copy of the given iterable (not
changing any element of the original iterable).

- map!(f, iter): maps a function f over the given iterable; does modify the
iterable.

- print(...): prints any number of objects to the screen, with a space between
each argument, followed by a newline.

- range(start [, stop [, step]]): if only one integer value is given, returns
an array with values from 0 to start-1. If two integer values are given, 
returns an array with values from start to stop-1 (or start to stop+1 if start>
stop). If two integer values are given, returns an array with values from 
start to stop+-1 with step value step.

- require(...): Compiles and executes the file referenced by any given
Poe strings if and only if the file has not been required before.

- size(...): Get the number of elements in any number of iterables.

- time(): Return the system time as an integer. (Its meaning is system-
dependent.)

- tochar(...): converts any number of ints/floats to characters.
- toint(...): converts any number of chars/floats to integers.
- tofloat(...): converts any number of chars/ints to floats.
- tostring(...): converts any number of objects to strings.
- type(...): returns the types of any number of objects as strings.

String library:

- string.toarr(s [, arr]): converts a string to an array, converting the
string's characters to integers. If an array buffer is given, the new array
is written into that array rather than a new array. 

- string.fromarr(arr [, s]): converts an array with integer members to a
string, storing the result in the string buffer it is given.

- string.cmp(s1, s2): compares two string objects, returning 0 if the strings
are the same, and some nonzero integer otherwise.

- string.concat(s1, s2 [, buf]): Concatenates the two given strings, storing
the result in the buffer if it is given, and in a new string otherwise.

- string.copy!(dest, src [, n [, max]]): Copy bytes from string src to
string dest, starting at index n if it is given, and copying max bytes
at most if it is given.

- string.find([str [, sub]]): find occurrences of sub in str; results are
returned as integer indices. After calling the function once with sub and
str arguments, you can call the function again with no arguments to search
again for a later occurrence.

- string.ncmp(s1, s2, n): compare the first n bytes of s1 and s2, returning
0 if they are the same, and nonzero otherwise.

- string.slice(s, start, finish [, buf]): copy the bytes start through finish
of s into the string buffer if it is given, and a new string if not.

Math library:
math.abs
math.arccos
math.arcsin
math.arctan
math.ceiling
math.cos
math.cosh
math.deg
math.ex
math.floor
math.fmod
math.log
math.log10
math.pi
math.pow
math.rad
math.rand
math.srand
math.sin
math.sinh
math.sqrt
math.tan
math.tanh

I/O library:

- io.close(...): close the given files.

- io.flush(...): flush the given files.

- io.open(filename, mode): open the given file with name filename under mode
mode.

- io.read(n [, file [, str]]): read at most n bytes from the given file (or
io.stdin if it is not given), storing the bytes in the given buffer (or
a new string if not given).

- io.readc([file]): read a character from the given file (or from io.stdin
if none is given).

- io.readf([file]): read a floating-point number from the given file
(or from io.stdin if none is given).

- io.readl([file [, str]]): read a line from the given file, storing the
line in the given buffer if one is given. If end-of-file is ever encountered,
io.readl returns true as a second argument.

- io.toarr(file): read the entire contents of the given file into an array
of strings, each string being one line of the file.

- io.tostr([file [, str]]): read the entire contents of a file into a single
string, storing the result in the given buffer if one is given.

- io.write(file, ...): Write argument strings, chars, or ints to given file. 
(Interprets integers as chars; for example, io.write(io.stdout, 97) prints 'a'.)

*-----TO-BE-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONS-----*
Global functions:


- run(...): executes any number of file, string, or bytecode objects on a
NEW Poe universe (not the current one).

- sandbox(eblk [, fblk[, ...]]): Executes eblk in a new table, which is made to
look like an "empty" global table; that is, it contains only standard library
functions. If fblk is given, executes fblk before eblk. fblk can be used to
"format" the new global table; for example, you can add/delete functions and
structures from this new global table with the instructions in fblk.

- setlocs(tab): set the current local table to the given table.






String functions: 

- string.code(...): converts bytecode objects to modifiable string objects.

- string.format(...): converts objects to strings according to the given format
string.

- string.token([ s, delims ]): Returns the next token in the given string. If
no arguments are given, look into the string._NEXT table for the relevant info.

- string.tokarray(s, delims): tokenizes a given string, returning an array of
strings split by delimiters.

- string.scan(s, format): Returns an array of values (chars, ints, floats,
strings) as determined by the format string.







GC functions:
gc.cycle(): Perform a complete GC cycle.
gc.majcyc(): Perform a complete GC major cycle.
gc.majoffset([int]): If an integer argument is given, set the major offset to
be that integer. If not, return the current major offset.
gc.start(): Restart the GC if it is stopped.
gc.step(): Perform a GC step.
gc.stepfactor([float]): If a float argument is given, set the step factor to
be that float. If not, return the current step factor.
gc.stop(): Stop the GC if it is running.
gc.timer([int]): If an integer argument is given, set the step factor to be
that timer. If not, return the current timer value.

I/O functions:

- io.withfile(name, mode, blk): Execute the given block with the given file --
storing that file under the symbol "file" -- and automatically close that file.
A return vector is given under the symbol R; this can be used to adjust what
the function will return. You can also "return" from within the function,
but you will have to manually io.close(file).

- io.tmp(): Return a temporary file; must be closed, and is deleted after being
closed.

- io.seek(...): Set the file position as per the arguments. 

- io.rewind(...): Rewind input stream.

- io.scan(file, format): Returns an array of values (ints, chars, strings, floats)
based on the given format string.

- io.remove(str): Remove the given file.
